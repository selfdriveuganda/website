```

## API Integration

### 1. Get OAuth Token
```typescript
const token = await getPesapalToken();
```

### 2. Register IPN (One-time setup)
```typescript
const ipn = await registerIPN('https://yourdomain.com/api/pesapal/ipn', 'GET');
// Save ipn.ipn_id to VITE_PESAPAL_IPN_ID
```

### 3. Submit Order
```typescript
const orderData = {
  id: 'BK-123456789',
  currency: 'USD',
  amount: 150.00,
  description: 'Car Rental: Toyota Land Cruiser',
  callback_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/booking/callback',
  notification_id: 'your-ipn-id',
  billing_address: {
    email_address: 'customer@example.com',
    phone_number: '+256700000000',
    country_code: 'UG',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
  },
};

const response = await submitOrder(orderData);
// Redirect user to response.redirect_url
window.location.href = response.redirect_url;
```

### 4. Verify Payment (Callback)
```typescript
const status = await getTransactionStatus(orderTrackingId);
if (status.payment_status_description === 'Completed') {
  // Payment successful - show confirmation
} else {
  // Payment failed - show error
}
```
